# Interview Preparation
This repository is organized in 3 sections: Algorithms, Data Structures, and Problems.

My cousin and friend, Andres (https://github.com/andresz1), suggested that I create a repository to show off the work that I have done in preparation for interviews. I believe that this repository can also be very helpful for other developers that are looking for problems and solutions.

For each section I have included tests that illustrate that my solutions are working.

I hope that others can take advantage of the work I have done.
